# Media & Information Design - LUCA Bxl - Nuxt 3 Starter

This is a template for students Media & Information Design - LUCA Bxl. It is a Nuxt based and is extended with 3 modules: [Nuxt Image](https://nuxt.com/modules/image), [Tailwind](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss) and [Color mode](https://nuxt.com/modules/color-mode)


Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/) to learn more. This repository implements [page transitions](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/transitions), [routing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing), [css style sheets](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/assets) and [creating navigations](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link#nuxtlink). 

Nuxt is based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and its a good approach to understand the basics of [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html). [NuxtLink](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) and [NuxtPage](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-page) are examples of Nuxt components that are based on a Vue logic.
